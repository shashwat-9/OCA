# Program Output

 - Data Produced by a program is called output, and it can be directed to different devices as required.
 - A Java program can send its output to terminal window using an object called Standard Output.
 - This Standard Output Object is found in class System as a static final object, and the object is of class
java.io.PrintStream(System.out).
 -  This class provides methods for printing values. These methods convert values to their text representation 
and print the resulting string.
 - The toString method of an object is called implicitly, if not explicitly before printing the object.
 - println() terminate the current line and print() doesn't.
