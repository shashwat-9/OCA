## Operators

### The Assignment Operator
Syntax for assignment is :
```
target = expression
```
 - target is a variable declared before, and expression must be assignable to the target variable.
 - previous value is overridden, and the type of target variable must be either primitive or reference.

#### Assigning primitive value
The assignment operator has the lowest precedence and thus the expression on the right is evaluated first.
