# Basic Language Elements

The basic language elements include low level elements using which high level constructs are formed.

### Lexical Tokens
Low level elements like Identifiers, numbers, operators, special character are called lexical token used to build 
high level constructs like expressions, statements, methods, and classes.

#### Identifier
Any name in the program is called an identifier, used to denote the name of classes, methods, variables and labels.
 - The identifier is named as a sequence of characters and digits, with the rule that identifier doesn't start with 
a digit.
 - The java program uses Unicode character set and thus the allowed character could be from different languages.
 - Underscore '_'(with other characters) and _currency_ symbols(such as $, ¢, ¥, or £) are also allowed.
 - '_' on itself is not a legal identifier but is a keyword in java(in SE17).
